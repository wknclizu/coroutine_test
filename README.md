# C++ Coroutine & Thread Performance Benchmark

This benchmark compares the performance of sequential execution, OS threads, and C++20 coroutines for concurrent tasks.

## Test Configuration

Calculate Fibonacci(30) using recursive algorithm, using clang++-21 with -O3 optimization

## Measurement Method

### Thread Measurement
- Creation time: Time to create all threads
- Compute+Join time: Time from starting all threads to join completion (parallel execution + cleanup)

### Coroutine Measurement
- Uses `suspend_always` at `initial_suspend()` to separate creation from execution
- Creation overhead: Measured from `promise_type()` constructor to `get_return_object()` completion
- Destruction overhead: Measured in `~Task()` destructor calling `handle.destroy()`
- Compute time: Measured explicitly during `resume()` calls

## Running the Benchmark

```bash
clang++-21 -std=c++23 -O3 coroutine3.cpp -o coroutine3

# Run with all CPU cores
./coroutine3

# Run with single CPU core
taskset -c 0 ./coroutine3
```

## TODOs
- [ ] The creation and destruction time of coroutine is faster than expected, check if it is correct
